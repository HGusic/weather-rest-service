# weather-rest-service
I created a fully functioning front and back end weather application by using GSON, a Java API, in order to call the API of The Weather Channel and parse the JSON object returned into a Java Object. Around this I built a very basic user interface using Javaâ€™s Swing toolkit to allow a user to easily get weather data based on input from any location, through city name or zip-code, in the United States.

The Source code is included HOWEVER there is also a JAR file included that runs without any IDE. 

Enjoy!
