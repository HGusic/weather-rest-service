# weather-rest-service
Software that displays accurate weather results to the user for any location in the country. The application makes web requests to receive data from the RESTful APIs of TWC and works with the GSON library to parse the data onto a basic UI.

The Source code is included HOWEVER there is also a JAR file included that runs without any IDE. 

Enjoy!
